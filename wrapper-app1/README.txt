# Step 1: Create a new React app wrapper (or use any empty folder)
npx create-react-app wrapper-app
cd wrapper-app

# Step 2: Initialize Capacitor in this folder
npx cap init django-game com.example.djangogame
# When prompted for web asset directory, type:
# public

# Step 3: Edit capacitor.config.json (or capacitor.config.ts) to add server URL
# Open capacitor.config.json and add under "server":
# {
#   "server": {
#     "url": "https://meetqonline.com/meetqlingo/?from_app=1",
#     "cleartext": true
#   }
# }

# Step 4: Add Android platform
npx cap add android

# Step 5: Sync Capacitor config and dependencies
npx cap sync

# Step 6: Open Android Studio project
npx cap open android

# Step 7: In Android Studio:
# - Build and run on emulator or device via Run ▶️

# Optional Step 8: Build APK for testing on device
# In Android Studio: Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
# Locate the APK and install on your device


for the Exit button to work: 
npm install @capacitor/app
npx cap sync


npm run build && npx cap sync && npx cap open android

Of course. Here is a summary of the project changes and a guide for how to switch to a live website.

### Summary of Changes Made

Throughout this process, we transformed a basic React application into a robust Android wrapper app. The primary goal was to display a web page within the app, and we solved several layers of networking and security issues to make it work for both development (emulator) and testing (real device).

1.  **Initial Goal & Iframe Blocking:** We started by trying to load an online website (`meetqonline.com`). We discovered the site uses the `X-Frame-Options: deny` security header, which blocks it from being loaded inside an `iframe` or a WebView. This is a server-side protection that cannot be bypassed from the app.

2.  **Switching to a Local Server:** We changed the goal to load a page from your local Django server. This introduced new challenges.

3.  **Emulator Connectivity (`Mixed Content` Error):** Your app was running on `https` while the server was on `http`, causing a "Mixed Content" error. We fixed this by forcing the app's scheme to `http` for Android.

4.  **Device Connectivity (IP Address & Whitelisting):** When testing on a real tablet, the app couldn't find the server because:
    *   It was using an emulator-only IP address (`10.0.2.2`). We switched to your computer's actual Wi-Fi IP (`192.168.1.8`).
    *   Android's security policy blocked this new IP. We fixed this by adding your Wi-Fi IP to a security whitelist, allowing the app to make requests to it.

### Files That Were Modified

Here are the key files that were changed to make this work:

1.  **`wrapper-app1/src/App.js`**
    *   **What:** The main logic of your app.
    *   **Changes:** We added the logic to `fetch` the server URL to check its status. Based on the result, it either displays the webpage in an `iframe` or shows a user-friendly "unavailable" message. This is where the `TARGET_URL` is defined.

2.  **`wrapper-app1/capacitor.config.ts`**
    *   **What:** The main configuration file for Capacitor.
    *   **Changes:** We added a `server` object to set the `androidScheme` to `http`. This was a crucial fix for the "Mixed Content" error during local development.

3.  **`wrapper-app1/android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`**
    *   **What:** An Android security policy file.
    *   **Changes:** We created this file and added your emulator IP (`10.0.2.2`) and your Wi-Fi IP (`192.168.1.8`) to a whitelist. This grants the app permission to send insecure `http` traffic to your local development server.

4.  **`wrapper-app1/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **What:** The core manifest for the Android app.
    *   **Changes:** We added a single line here to tell the Android OS to use the `network_security_config.xml` file.

### How to Switch to an Online Website (for Production)

To make your app work with a live, online website instead of your local server, you will need to make the following changes.

**Step 1: Change the Target URL**

*   Open `wrapper-app1/src/App.js`.
*   Find the `TARGET_URL` constant and change it from your local IP to your live website's URL. The URL **must use `https`**.

    ```javascript
    // Change this:
    const TARGET_URL = "http://192.168.1.8:8000/meetqlingo/?from_app=1";

    // To your live website URL:
    const TARGET_URL = "https://www.your-live-website.com/";
    ```

**Step 2: Revert Capacitor Config to `https`**

The `androidScheme: 'http'` setting was a workaround for local development. For a live site, you should revert to the more secure default.

*   Open `wrapper-app1/capacitor.config.ts`.
*   Change the `server` configuration back to `https`.

    ```typescript
    // Change this:
    server: {
      hostname: 'localhost',
      androidScheme: 'http'
    }

    // To this (or remove the server object entirely):
    server: {
      androidScheme: 'https'
    }
    ```

**Step 3: Ensure Your Live Site Allows Embedding**

*   **This is the most important step.** You must control the server for your live website.
*   You need to configure its server to **not** send the `X-Frame-Options: deny` header. If it does, your app will show a blank page, and there is nothing you can do from the app to fix it. This was the original problem we encountered.

**Step 4: Rebuild**

*   After making these changes, run the usual build process to create your final production APK:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    npx cap sync
    ```
